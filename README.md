# üöÄ My Neovim Configuration

Welcome to my Neovim configuration! This setup is designed to provide a powerful, efficient, and enjoyable coding experience. This config might be very opinionated and specific to my use-cases, but I hope it helps or inspires someone else as well!

> [!NOTE]
> Some parts of this setup work in conjunction with my general dotfile repository at [strayer/dotfiles](https://github.com/strayer/dotfiles), especially the auto dark/light mode feature.

## ‚ú® Features

- üé® Modern and sleek UI with carefully chosen colorschemes
- üß† Intelligent code completion powered by nvim-cmp
- üîç Fuzzy finding capabilities with fzf-lua
- üå≥ File explorer with oil.nvim and neo-tree
- üîß Robust LSP configuration for various languages (including Ansible, Bash, Docker, Python, Lua, Terraform, Vue, YAML, Ruby, JSON, Go, PowerShell, and more)
- üß© Syntax highlighting and advanced code analysis with Treesitter
- ü§ñ AI-assisted coding integration with gp.nvim and avante.nvim
- üìä Handy status line with lualine
- üöÄ Efficient plugin management with lazy.nvim
- üåì Automatic dark/light mode switching based on system preferences

## üõ† Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Currently tested with Neovim v0.10.1

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```
2. Start Neovim and let it install the plugins:
   ```sh
   nvim
   ```

## üéÆ Key Mappings

This configuration uses which-key as a central part of the key binding setup, providing an interactive menu for discovering and using keybindings. Here are some of the main custom mappings related to core features:

- `<Leader>f`: Fuzzy find files (fzf-lua)
- `<Leader>s`: Various search operations (buffers, git branches, diagnostics, etc.)
- `<Leader>e`: File explorer operations (neo-tree)
- `<Leader>l`: LSP-related commands
- `<Leader>d`: Debugging commands
- `<C-h/j/k/l>`: Navigate between splits (works across both Neovim and Wezterm splits)

Press `<Leader>` (space key) to bring up the which-key menu and explore more available commands.
